Eye state classification (Open/Closed) using SVM model

Audio alert system (alarm.mp3) to wake up drowsy drivers

Model training (train_eye.py) and evaluation scripts included

Lightweight and works with a standard webcam

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Tools: OpenCV, dlib, scikit-learn, NumPy

Machine Learning Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/driver-drowsiness-detection-system.git
cd driver-drowsiness-detection-system


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


(If you don’t have a requirements.txt, create one with the libraries used: OpenCV, dlib, scikit-learn, numpy)

▶️ Usage

Run the detection system:

python detect_drowsiness.py


The webcam will open and start monitoring the driver’s eye movements.

If drowsiness is detected, an alarm sound will play.

📊 Model Training

To retrain the eye state classification model:

python train_eye.py


Evaluate the model:

python evaluate_error_and_validation.py
